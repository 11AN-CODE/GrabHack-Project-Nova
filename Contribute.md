Contributing to Project Nova

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Project Nova! It's people like you that make the open-source community such an amazing place. We welcome any and all contributions.

This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to Project Nova. These are mostly guidelines, not strict rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.
How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and documentation to submitting bug reports and feature requests.
Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue with the "enhancement" label. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it's needed, and how it should work.
Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Project Nova? You can start by looking through good first issue and help wanted issues:

    Good first issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

    Help wanted - issues which should be a bit more involved than good first issues.

Pull Requests

The process for submitting a pull request is as follows:

    Fork the repository and create your branch from main.

    git checkout -b name-of-your-feature-or-fix

    Set up your development environment. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install the project dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Make your changes. Make sure to follow the coding style (PEP 8 for Python).

    Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    git commit -m "feat: Describe your new feature"
    git commit -m "fix: Describe the bug you fixed"

    Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

    git push origin name-of-your-feature-or-fix

    Open a Pull Request to the main branch of the AyushMann29/GrabHack-Project-Nova repository.

    In the pull request description, clearly describe the changes you have made and reference the issue number it fixes (e.g., Fixes #123).
